## 🌟 Learn DSA with Java: Mastering the Fundamentals 🚀

---

### **📖 Overview**

Welcome to the **Learn DSA with Java** repository! This project is a comprehensive resource designed to help you master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using the powerful and widely-used **Java** programming language.

Whether you're a beginner starting your coding journey, a student preparing for exams, or a professional aiming to ace technical interviews, this repository is your one-stop solution for clear, well-commented, and optimized Java implementations.

### **✨ Why Java for DSA?**

Java is an excellent choice for learning DSA due to its strong typing, clear Object-Oriented structure, and extensive standard library, which allows for robust and scalable implementations of complex concepts.

### **📚 Contents: Roadmap & Topics Covered**

The content is organized logically, building complexity step-by-step. Each topic includes **Java code implementation**, **detailed explanations**, and **time/space complexity analysis** (e.g., $O(n)$, $O(\log n)$).

| Section | Key Topics | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Fundamentals** | Complexity Analysis, Arrays, Strings, Recursion, Bit Manipulation | ✅ Complete |
| **II. Linear Structures** | Linked Lists (Singly/Doubly/Circular), Stacks, Queues, Deques | ✅ Complete |
| **III. Non-Linear Structures** | Trees (BST, AVL, Red-Black), Heaps (Min/Max), Hashing (HashMaps/Sets) | ⏳ In Progress |
| **IV. Searching/Sorting** | Binary Search, Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick Sort | ✅ Complete |
| **V. Advanced Topics** | Graphs (Traversal, Shortest Path), Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms | 🚧 Planning |

### **🛠️ Setup and Requirements**

To run and test the code examples in this repository, you will need the following installed:

1.  **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.
2.  **IDE (Recommended):** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with the Java Extension Pack.
3.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Shubham-Mallick/learn-dsa-with-java.git](https://github.com/Shubham-Mallick/learn-dsa-with-java.git)
    cd learn-dsa-with-java
    ```
    
> **Note:** Remember to replace `YourUsername` in the clone command and badges with your actual GitHub username.

### **💡 How to Use This Repository**

1.  **Start with the Basics:** Begin with the **Complexity Analysis** and **Arrays** folders to build a strong foundation.
2.  **Analyze the Code:** Each file provides a clear, runnable implementation. Pay special attention to the comments explaining the logic and complexity.
3.  **Practice:** After studying a concept, try to re-implement the structure/algorithm yourself *without* looking at the provided solution.
